# Centive Network

Welcome to **Centive Network**, the cutting-edge decentralized contribution measurement and consensus network designed for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). Centive Network is here to optimize the way nodes in distributed networks contribute, ensuring that each node's resources are utilized efficiently, fairly, and transparently.

Our goal is to enable DePIN services to focus on what matters most‚Äîtheir core infrastructure‚Äîwhile Centive Network handles contribution tracking, dynamic reward distribution, fault detection, and consensus.

## üåü **Key Features**

### 1. **Optimistic Contribution Process**
   - Nodes commit their contribution intent with minimal overhead.
   - Real-time monitoring with **APM agents** and **E2E tests** ensures performance tracking.
   - Nodes get paid based on sustained contributions rather than resource-heavy proofs.

### 2. **Validator Consensus & Secret Voting**
   - Verifiers monitor and validate node activity through an efficient, hidden voting mechanism.
   - Faults are detected through automated reports and **secret voting** to reach consensus.
   - Incorrect behavior results in **slashing** to ensure network security.

### 3. **Dynamic Reward Allocation**
   - Centive's flexible reward mechanism adapts to different service types (e.g., storage, compute).
   - Reward distribution models can be customized to meet the specific needs of each DePIN project.

### 4. **Cross-Chain Support**
   - Centive Network operates as a **multi-chain network**, allowing you to deploy reward systems across multiple blockchains.

### 5. **Automated Slashing**
   - Ensure network integrity through configurable slashing mechanisms that penalize underperforming or malicious nodes.
